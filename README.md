=========

An inter-active GUI where mouse clicks plot points on a 2D panel and a convex hull is drawn by the program for the set of points.

Left clicks add points. Right clicks deletes an entered points.

A 'Refresh' button clears the panel of points and lines and renders it blank.

A 'Draw' button draws the convex hull for the points that have registeres in the panel.


Note : LinkedLists.java is inherited by ConvexHull.java, which is the file to be compiled and run
